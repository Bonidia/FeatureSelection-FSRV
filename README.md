## List of files

 - **Datasets:** Datasets;

 - **Algorithm** Main File - Python;

 - **README:** Documentation;

 - **Requirements:** List of items to be installed using pip install.


## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.7.4)
- NumPy 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Skfeature-chappers


## Installing our tool

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Bonidia/FeatureSelection-FSRV.git FeatureSelection-FSRV

$ cd FeatureSelection-FSRV

$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usange and Examples


```sh
Access folder: $ cd FeatureSelection-FSRV
 
To run the feature selection tool (Example): $ python3.7 algorithm.py 3 2 dataset.csv

Where:

Algorithm =  Genetic Algorithm/Metaheuristic

3 = Function of decomposing solutions

dataset.csv = file with features

```
This example will generate a csv file with the selected features.

**Note:** Input samples for feature selection must be in csv format.
